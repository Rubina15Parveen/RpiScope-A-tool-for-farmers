<h3>WHEAT DISEASES</h3>

<h4><u> POWDERY MILDEW </u></h4>
<img src="1.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="hello3.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p aligh="justify">
Greyish white powdery growth appears on the leaf, sheath, stem and floral parts.
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Enhance air circulation by spacing plants well apart. Better ventilation will reduce the disease. Dense plants can be thinned out to improve air flow.</li>
<li>A spray made with baking soda, if applied weekly at the first signs of infection, can protect plants against further damage.</li>
<li>Plants that are badly infected should be ripped out and destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further.</li>
<li>A commercially available organic option is Neem oil, which both treats existing powdery mildew and protects the plant against further infection.</li>


<h4><u> BLACK RUST </u></h4>
<img src="hello2.jpg" width="80%" height="263">
<p align="justify">
Symptoms are produced on almost all aerial parts of the wheat plant but are most common on stem, leaf sheaths and upper and lower leaf surfaces.
Pustules (containing masses of urediospores) are dark reddish brown - occur on both sides of the leaves, on the stems, and on the spikes.
Pustules are usually separate and scattered, heavy infections -coalesce.
Prior to pustule formation, "flecks" may appear. Before the spore masses break through the epidermis, the infection sites feel rough to the touch.
As the spore masses break through, the surface tissues take on a ragged and torn appearance.
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Grow rust-resistant varieties of wheat recommended for a particular area such as HD-2733, HD-2428, HD-2189, U.P.2425, PBW-343, HW-291, HW-2004, HS-240, VL-719 etc. it is safer to divide the total farm area for wheat cultivation under 3-4 different varieties of wheat.</li>
<li>Do not use excess nitrogenous fertilizers, as very high nitrogen dose favours rust development.</li> 
<li>Use of high dose of potash is known to reduce rust infection. Apply balanced doses of nitrogen and potash as recommended.</li> 
<li>Damage by wheat rust may be minimized by spraying Zineb or Mencozeb 75 WP.</li> 
<li>Spraying is recommended only when a good crop of wheat is threatened by rusts.</li>
<li>Spray 0.2 per cent Zineb or Mencozeb 75 WP and 0.1 per cent Sandovit (spreader-sticker).</li>


<h4><u> STINKING SMUT </u></h4>
<img src="hello.jpg" align="center" width="80%" height="263">
<p align="justify">
The fungus attacks seedling of 8-10 days old and become systemic and grows along the tip of shoot. 
At the time of flowering hyphae concentrate in the inflorescence and spikelets and transforming the ovary into smut sorus of dark green color with masses of chlamydospores.
The diseased plants mature earlier and all the spikelets are affected.
</p>
<h4> Copper Carbonate Treatment For Stinking Smut of Wheat Winter Wheat</h4>
<li>Use two to four ounces of 50 per cent copper carbonate to each bushel of re-cleaned seed. Mix until each kernel is thoroughly coated.</li>
<li>Spring Wheat: Use two ounces of 50 per cent copper carbonate or two to three ounces of 20 per cent copper carbonate to each bushel of re-cleaned seed. Mix until each kernel is thoroughly coated. </li> 


<h4><u> BROWN RUST</u> </h4>
<img src="2.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="3.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p align="justify">
The postules are circular or slightly elliptical, smaller than those of stem rust, usually do not coalesce, and contain masses of orange to orange-brown urediospores.
Infection sites primarily are found on the upper surfaces of leaves and leaf sheaths and occasionally on the neck and awns.
</p>
<h4> MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Early sown crops are at greater risk of brown rust, especially if a mild winter follows, as they are more likely to be infected by the wind-blown spores.</li>
<li>Resistant varieties are available, they need to be monitored regularly for the disease, as it is a very diverse pathogen and new races can occur.</li> 
<li>Fungicides containing azoles, strobilurins and SDHIs are very effective, providing treatment intervals do not exceed three to four weeks. Under high disease pressure, these intervals may need to be shorter.</li>

<h3>RICE DISEASES</h3>

<h4><u> RICE BLAST </u></h4>
<img src="r1.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="r2.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p aligh="justify">
Rice blast is a fungus that feeds on the rice plant, causing severe damage usually during the seedling stage.
It attacks different parts of the plant: the collar, which can ultimately kill the entire leaf blade; the stem, 
which turns blackish and breaks easily (node blast); the neck of the panicle, where the infected part is girdled by a grayish brown lesion, 
or when severe, causes the panicles to fall over; or on the branches of the panicles which exhibit brown lesions when infected.
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Use of resistant varieties like Gauthami, IR-36, IR-64, Parijatha, Rasi, Sasyashree, Salivahana, Simhapuri, Srinivas, Tikkana</li>
<li>Burn previously blast affected straw and stubbles.</li>
<li>Use of balanced rates of nutrition based on soil test- split applications of nitrogen  (Excessive N use can promote excessive luxuriant crop growth which increases the relative humidity and leaf wetness of the crop canopy. This can lead to increased infection).</li>
<li>Spray 1g of carbendazim (780g/acre) or 1 ml edifenphos (780ml/acre) or 0.6g of  tricyclazole (120g/acre)  in 1 liter of water, depending on severity repeat spray at 10-12 days of first spray.</li>

<h4><u> BROWN SPOT</u></h4>
<img src="r3.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="r4.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p aligh="justify">
Typical spots on the leaves are oval, about the size and shape of sesame seeds. 
The spots are relatively uniform and fairly evenly distributed over the leaf surface. 
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Improving soil fertility is the first step in managing brown spot. </li>
<li>Use resistant varieties. </li>
<li>Use fungicides (e.g., iprodione, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and carbendazim) as seed treatments.</li>
<li>Treat seeds with hot water for 10 to 12 minutes before planting, to control primary infection at the seedling stage.</li>

<h4><u>BLACK KERNEL</u></h4>
<img src="r5.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="r6.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p aligh="justify">
The fungus Curvularia lunata causes black kernel of rice.
The fungus causes severe grain discoloration, and
after milling, the kernels appear black. 
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Use resistant varieties.</li>
<li>Spray - Carbendazim + Thiram + Mancozeb (1:1:1) 0.2% at 50% flowering stage. </li>


<h4><u>FALSE SMUT</u></h4>
<img src="r7.jpg"  width="50%" height="263">
<img src="r8.jpg"  align="right" width="50%" height="263">
<p aligh="justify">
Individual rice grain transformes into a mass of yellow fruiting bodies.
Growth of velvety spores appears which encloses floral parts.
Immature spores which are slightly flattened, smooth, yellow, and covered by a membrane.
</p>
<h4>MEASURES TO BE TAKEN</h4>
<li>Reduce humidity levels through alternate wetting and drying (AWD) rather than permanently flooding the fields.</li>
<li>Use moderate rates of Nitrogen.</li>
<li>Where possible, perform conservation tillage and continuous rice cropping.</li>
